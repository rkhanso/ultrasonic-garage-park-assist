Use a HC-SR04 Ultrasonic Sensor to guide the car into the garage

My goal was to make it easy for the wife to pull in the garage and know when to stop so the back of her car would clear the garage door. I used to use a short 2x4 laying on the floor, but it would end up being kicked around and end up in the wrong location. I thought about the tennis ball on a string, but who wants to keep running into a tennis ball when walking around their garage.

With Home Assistant, I can set a script and automation so this device is only active when the door is open
